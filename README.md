# Implementation of Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) using MATLAB GUI
This makes use of MATLAB GUI to simulate PCM concept in MATLAB. There is also a simulink model that simulates the same concept for voice signal. The GUI simulates PCM for real time voice signal and plots the various graphs accordingly.
